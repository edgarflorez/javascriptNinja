	<ul>
		<li>A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things: a function, and the environment in which that function was created. The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time that the closure was created. In this case, myFunc is a closure that incorporates both the displayName function and the "Mozilla" string that existed when the closure was created.</li>
		<li>In essence, makeAdder is a function factory — it creates functions which can add a specific value to their argument. In the above example we use our function factory to create two new functions — one that adds 5 to its argument, and one that adds 10.
			<ul>
				<li>add5 and add10 are both closures. They share the same function body definition, but store different environments. In add5's environment, x is 5. As far as add10 is concerned, x is 10.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

		//Lexical scoping
		function init(){
			var name = "Mozilla";
			function displayName(){
				console.log("Lexical scoping ",name );
			}
			displayName();
		}
		init();

		//Closure
		function makeFunc() {
			var name = "Mozilla";
			function displayName(){
				console.log("Closure ",name);
			}
			return displayName;
		}
		var myFunc = makeFunc();
		myFunc();

		//Closures Function Factory
		function makeAdder(x) {
			return function(y){
				return x + y;
			}
		}

		var add5 	= makeAdder(5);
		var add10	= makeAdder(10);

		console.log(add5(2));	// 7
		console.log(add10(5));	// 12
